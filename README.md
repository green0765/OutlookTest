Hi Guys,my Name is Guangyu Wu.I have been an Android developer for about two years.

And in my recent 2 years' job, I meanly did two works:

1.Develop the decoder of android App for different kinds of chips (Hisi, MTK, Mstar and etc) and optimize the latency of decoding and display to less than 100ms.

2.Customize the Android X86 virtual machine:Modify the EGL of Android system to intercept all the OpenGL instructions and send them to the host machine , which start up a player to parsing these instructions and rendering them by OpenGL or D3D.Modify the Arm Translator, JIT, SurfaceView and other parts of system to optimize the compatibility of the system and make nearly all kinds of Android game can be played on our virtual machine.
